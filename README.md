# tmux-vim-select-pane

## Deprecated

This script should no longer be necessary. It's possible to inline the
script directly into the tmux configuration using tmux `if-shell` commands. For
more on this approach see the [thoughtbot blog post][thoughtbot] or the readme
for [vim-tmux-navigator][navigator]. Issue with inline scripting can be opened
in the vim-tmux-navigator repository.

## Overview

This is a repackaging of the split pane switching script used in
[Mislav MarohniÄ‡'s][mislav] tmux-navigator configuration described in this
[gist][gist].

Please note that this is only the script used to switch panes. To fully enable
this functionality you will need to follow the instructions below (assumes
